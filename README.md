### To read, write, and display Images & Videos
We will set up a basic understanding of how we can begin learning image processing with OpenCV by reading, writing, and displaying images as well videos using OpenCV methods like imshow(), imread(), etc. 

### OpenCV
Open-source library for the Computer Vision, Machine Learning & Image Processing.

### Basic Functions
After we have established a basic understanding, we will learn about various methods on images to resize, blur, etc.

### Shapes and Texts
We will learn about the various shapes that we can put the images into and with corresponding text values as their labels

### Joining Images
This section particularly focuses on how we can join the images together.
